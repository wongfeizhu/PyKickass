# PyKickass
This is a textual approach for searching Kickass Torrents file information without a browser. 

The script basically pulls data from kick ass torrents via a json endpoint and populates
it in a sqlite db.

The results can be reviewed via simple canned reports or by directly querying the sqlite database
using the advanced user option. 

This is more like a starter or skeleton code. I used this for a proof of concept somewhere and wanted
to share as I believe someone can build upon it for their own purposes.

Maybe Kickass Torrents already has an actual API around somewhere (I did not research that). I just 
stumbled on that endpoint and decided to make use of it.

Installation:

There are several python modules that the application depends on. For simplicity, just run 
the installation script. Sudo may be required if running under a non-privileges account.

The program natively installs to /opt  . If yo wish otherwise, you may have to change it in the 
installation file as well as in a few places in the source.

How to Use:

The program is pretty much menu driven and easy to follow.
